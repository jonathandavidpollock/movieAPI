# Search for a movie with the OMDB Movie API
This project uses the fetch API and the OMDB api to search for movies. Much like my [Spotify API Project](https://github.com/jonathandavidpollock/spotifyAPI),
this application recieves a request from the user and performs a GET request to the [OMDB api](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

It also utilizes the MVC pattern and the Javascript singleton pattern. Why use the Singleton pattern you say? Because I wanted to. My friends and I were talking about the pattern and I wanted to try and use it in a project. It doesn't necessarily make sense for the application. Quiet frankly, it's overkill. But the Singleton Pattern
is a tool you want in your back pocket. I am proud to say I know how to do it now! 

> Side Note: MVC is JS in amazing. Shoutout to Javasript Events! Think of this, your Models can fire off an event whenever they complete and tell the View, "Hey, I'm done. Here's the data." Just attach the data from your model to an event!
