# Movie API
This project uses the fetch API and the OMDB api to search for movies. Much like my [Spotify API Project](https://github.com/jonathandavidpollock/spotifyAPI),
the appliction recieves a request from the user and performs a GET request to the [OMDB api](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

It also utilizes MVC and the Javascript singleton pattern.Why use the Singleton pattern you say? Because I wanted to. My friends and I were talking about the pattern
and I wanted to try and use it in a project. It doesn't necessarily make sense for the application. Quiet frankly, it's overkill. But the Singleton Pattern
is a tool you want in your back pocket!
